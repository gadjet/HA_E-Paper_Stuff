# HA_E-Paper_Stuff
Just some service files for sending data from sensors in home assistant through the Open Epaper Access point to specific Epaper price tags.
Just edit the Tag ID and the sensor details in the file then paste the code into the actions section of an automation in HA.
I've sourced my info from here https://github.com/jonasniesner/open_epaper_link_homeassistant/tree/main

Also I've added an STL file for the tag, it's a basic model to allow stands to be designed etc.

I've added a very basic stand to hold the tag
